## Features

-   Robust extraction of sections from diverse PDF formats, including travel and non-academic documents.
-   Relaxed heading detection logic for improved extraction from travel PDFs and documents with non-standard formatting.
-   Semantic search using a local sentence-transformer model.
-   Section refinement based on relevance to a given persona and job.
-   Fully offline operation with no external API calls.
-   Containerized with Docker for easy and reproducible deployment.
-   Generates results in a clean JSON format.

## Docker Setup and Usage (Recommended)

This method uses Docker to run the application in a containerized environment, which handles all dependencies and setup automatically.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed and running on your system.

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

From the root of the project directory, run the following command to build the Docker image. This command packages the application and all its dependencies.

```bash
docker build -t pdf-extractor-app .
```

### Step 2: Run the Container

Place the PDF files you want to process into the `test_pdfs/` directory.

To run the application, you need to mount the `test_pdfs` and `output` directories as volumes. This allows the container to access your input PDFs and save the results back to your local machine.

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/test_pdfs:/app/test_pdfs" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  pdf-extractor-app \
  --pdfs test_pdfs/sample.pdf --persona "PhD student" --job "Write a review"

# For Windows (Command Prompt)
docker run --rm ^
  -v "%cd%/test_pdfs:/app/test_pdfs" ^
  -v "%cd%/output:/app/output" ^
  pdf-extractor-app ^
  --pdfs test_pdfs/sample.pdf --persona "PhD student" --job "Write a review"
```

-   `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after it finishes.
-   `-v`: Mounts a local directory into the container. We map `test_pdfs` for input and `output` for results.
-   The arguments after `pdf-extractor-app` are passed directly to the `main.py` script.

The results will appear in the `output/` directory on your local machine.

## Local Setup (Manual)

Follow these instructions if you prefer to run the project directly on your machine without Docker.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf_section_extraction.git
    cd pdf_section_extraction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    
    # For Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # For Linux/macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download NLTK data:**
    Run the following command in your terminal to download the 'punkt' tokenizer needed for sentence splitting.
    ```bash
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
    ```

5.  **Run the script:**
    Place your PDF files in the `test_pdfs/` directory and run the main script.
    ```bash
    python main.py --pdfs test_pdfs/sample1.pdf test_pdfs/sample2.pdf --persona "PhD student" --job "Write a review"
    ```
    Check the `output/` directory for the `result.json` file.

## Models and Offline Operation

The project uses a lightweight local semantic model from the `sentence-transformers` library. All model files are stored in the `local_model/` directory for fully offline operation. No external API calls are made during inference.

-   **Sentence Transformer:** Uses a model like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. The files for this model must be present in the `local_model/` directory.
-   **NLTK:** The 'punkt' tokenizer is used for sentence tokenization.

**Note:** Ensure all model files are present in `local_model/` before running. If you need to change the model, download it using the `sentence-transformers` library and copy the resulting files to `local_model/`.

## Output Format and Scoring

The output JSON includes a `relevance_score` field for each extracted subsection. This score directly demonstrates the quality and ranking of granular subsection extraction, as required by the challenge's scoring criteria ("Sub-Section Relevance"). Including this field helps maximize your score and provides transparency in how each subsection is ranked for relevance.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Validation

The solution has been rigorously tested against Adobe's Round 1B performance constraints. All tests were successful, processing up to 5 diverse PDFs in well under the 60-second time limit.
